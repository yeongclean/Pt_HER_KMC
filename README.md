**Understanding HER(Hydrogen Evolution Reaction) Mechanisms and Kinetics under constant POTENTIAL**

The primary objective of this research is to investigate the reaction mechanism and kinetics of Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) at the anode of fuel cells under constant potential conditions. To achieve this, I will employ VASPsol++ to calculate activation barriers and free energies of various HER pathways in an implicit solvation environment. The goal is to systematically analyze how the reaction energetics change with electrode potential.


This study focuses primarily on well-defined crystalline platinum surfaces, such as Pt(111), Pt(100), and Pt(211). And then, it will examine structurally irregular surfaces, including grain boundaries and amorphous Pt models. Additionally, Au surfaces will be used for comparative analysis when necessary.
Focusing on the representative HER pathway (Volmer, Tafel, and Heyrovsky mechanisms), I will evaluate the potential-dependent reaction barriers. In particular, the following pathways will be studied in detail:

•	In acid:
2Pt* + 2H+ + 2e- -> 2PtH -> 2Pt + H2

•	In alkaline or cation-rich:
2Pt* + 2H2O + cation -> 2PtH + 2OH- + cation -> 2Pt + H2 + 2OH- + cation

Based on the computed activation barriers, I will further perform constant-potential Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations to kinetically assess:

* The effect of applied potential on reaction rates
* The influence of catalyst surface structure (crystalline, amorphous, defective)
* The impact of pH and specific cation environments of HER performance

 Ultimately, this research aims to establish fundamental design principles for optimizing HER efficiency. Furthermore, the obtained insights may guide strategies to enhance the durability and selectivity of Pt-based electrodes for fuel cell applications.
